## **Introduction to Next JS**

In May 2013, when developers at Facebook came up with React, it was with the very aim of clinically seizing this new tomorrow. As a component-based library, React was profound. Not only did it accord web developers an unprecedented degree of convenience to build the UI, but it also facilitated a level of efficiency that was hitherto unheard of.

However, when this component-based development sentiment was at its absolute peak, along came Next JS in the year 2016\. With Next JS at disposal, developers no longer had to limit themselves to building components. Now, they could build entire pages. It presented itself as a complete solution to the developers and provided business owners, marketers, and entrepreneurs with a bevy of enterprising advantages.

## **A Deep Dive**

In essence, Next.JS is a framework based on JavaScript, utilized for building superfast static websites and React web applications. Via its Automatic Static Optimisation feature, developers get the liberty of building an application inclusive of both server-rendered and statically generated pages.

As a platform, the most redeeming factor about Next.JS lays in fact, that it was successful in bringing together the following three functionalities:

*   A rich user experience that was substantially faster and more user-friendly than what was ever made possible by other platforms in the past.
*   An unparalleled degree of performance.
*   The scope of rapid feature development.

Courtesy of these appealing features, everyone ranging from up and coming startups to established organizations such as Netflix and Uber switched operations to this framework.

Consequently, Next JS is now identified as among the fastest-growing React frameworks in the world. And has become the foremost tool of choice while working with any static site out there.

## **When Should You Use Next JS?**

Before you proceed with using or integrating any technology with your operations, the thumb rule should completely align with your business goals.

Listed below are the enhancements that Next JS helps you incorporate into your business.

*   Usually, websites and applications developed with Next JS exhibit high standards of adaptability and responsiveness. They can adapt to any screen and work on any device that launches them.
*   The static site doesn’t harbor a direct link to any database, user data, dependencies, or other sensitive information. Thus the security of the data is upheld at all times. Additionally, because they are static, the load time is relatively much shorter as well.

## **Benefits for Marketing**

*   Using Next JS helps you meet vital page ranking factors such as structure, speed, and UX. This helps you drive a higher volume of organic traffic to your website and ensures that your page ranks higher than those of your competitors.

## **Benefits for Development**

*   The Next JS framework comes with a built-in CSS support that allows developers to import CSS files from a JavaScript file.
*   It also possesses a built-in Automatic Image Optimisation feature that automatically optimizes images by using the image component.
*   It gives developers the liberty of updating existing pages by re-rendering them in the background alongside the incoming traffic.

## **Conclusion**
